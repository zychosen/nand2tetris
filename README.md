# Building a computer 
This is the implementation of a computer starting from NAND gates as part of the nand2tetris course.

### Hardware hierarchy
   * Project 1: Boolean Logic (logic gates, mux, demux etc.)
   * Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic (ALU, Adders etc.)
   * Project 3: Sequential Logic (Registers, counters etc.)
   * Project 4: Machine Language (Assembly language)
   * Project 5: Computer Architecture (CPU, Memory)
   * Project 6: Assembler (Assembly to machine code (binary))

### Software hierarchy
   * Project 7: VM-1: Virtual Machine implementation (Stack Arithmetic translator)
   * Project 8: VM-2: Virtual Machine implementation (Full VM translator)
