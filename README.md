# Building a computer 
This is the implementation of a computer starting from NAND gates as part of the nand2tetris course.

   * Project 1: Boolean Logic (logic gates, mux, demux etc.)
   * Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic (ALU, Adders etc.)
   * Project 3: Sequential Logic (Registers, counters etc.)
   * Project 4: Machine Language (Assembly language)
   * Project 5: Computer Architecture (CPU, Memory)
   * Project 6: Assembler (Assembly to machine code (binary))
